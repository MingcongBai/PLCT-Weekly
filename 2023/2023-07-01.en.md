# This Month in PLCT: Issue 47 (July 1, 2023)

## Preface

RISC-V's outreach has been moving forward at blinding pace in the past month. In June, we saw the opening of the inaugural RISC-V Summit in Europe, RISC-V Day in Tokyo, the return of SiFive's tour in mainland China, as well as the Chinese Academy of Sciences' first RuyiSDK Open Day. We would also like to take this moment to congratulate Dr. Qiu Ji 邱吉 at the PLCT Lab for becoming a RISC-V Ambassador at RISC-V International.

Still, we are reminded of RISC-V founder Dr. Krste's comment that software ecosystem is of utmost importance of rhte success of an instruction set architecture. We must realise that, despite the unstoppable forward movement of open source software success, commercial and industrial software support for RISC-V still leaves much room for further development. To realise this development, we will congregate more talents and resources. In the next three to five years, we plan to port and optimize top-1000 software solutions from 18 foundational and key industries. Let's work together and make it happen.

For those who joined PLCT for over a year, June marked a moment for farewell. From late June, the PLCT Lab will encourage and instruct young engineers to find new venues for further self-development. The organizational adjustment will affect about half of our employees, lasting into Q3 2023. While there may be pain and sadness, this adjustment also marks for many a ticket into a promising new future.

## GNU Toolchain

- Created repository under the RuyiSDK organization, maintaining GCC 10/13 and Binutils 2.35/2.36/2.40, tracking updates to each extension versions:
  - https://github.com/ruyisdk/riscv-gnu-toolchain
- Attmepted to implement RVV 0.7 instructions in Binutils 2.40 with compatibility for RVV 1.0. Users may switch between versions by specifying V extension versions - `-march=rv64gcv0p7` denotes usage for RVV 0.7 and `-march=rv64gcv1p0` specifies. The current implementation passes all instruction generation tests.
  - https://github.com/pz9115/binutils-gdb-1/commit/95185721967cbf9bcedcee1572ea361b91bca53e

## DynamoRIO for RV64GC

This month, we worked predominantly on Box64 and has therefore did not submit any new pull requests. Those that were submitted in May were reviewed and merged.

Up to this point, the basic infrastructures reached preliminary completion. The next step will be working on utility functions for code emit components. In July, we will re-double our effort on DyanoRIO to realise our goal from back in June - running a Hello World program on DynamoRIO.

## OpenCV for RISC-V

\[WIP\] Automated OpenCV Universal Intrinsic code migrator for the RVV backend.
  - Detects Universal Intrinsic types.
  - Supports rewriting vector lengths and overloaded operators in vector types.
  - Git repository: https://github.com/hanliutong/rewriter

The first patch generated by the code migrator has been accepted by the upstream, https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23885

## LIBCXX Experimental/simd

- Upstream work.

  - Created a test libcxx-simd repository for Compiler Explorer. Users may start testing by including the header, see [LibCxx SIMD: Single Header Library
](https://github.com/plctlab/simd_for_godbolt)
	- Implemented tests for internal interfaces.
	- Rebased code against the LLVM upstream and resolved issues in clang-tidy code.
	- Implemented simd/simd_mask classes and explicit type conversion interfaces for its internal storage types.

## LuaJIT for RV64G

JIT is now largely functional; LuaJIT/LuaJIT-test-cleanup could pass 505/508 cases, on par with LuaJIT on other platform. Programs like Minetest, Scimark, and Sysbench are said to be running without any issues.

There are still some bugs to be fixed, for instance, LuaRocks complains about invalid table metamethods, and NeoVim may segfault while building with a malformed string pointer access.

Additionally, the program doesn't currently have debug information for unwinding. These ought to be fixed soon.

## box64

This month, we continued to improve the dynamic recompiler for the RV64 JIT backend and continued work on library wrappers. We fixed several complicated bugs, added support for more opcodes, and wrapped more libraries and functions (mainly GUI-related).

Another highlight is that we added experimental support for Wine's WoW64 support. With newer Wine versions, you should now be able to run simple 32-bit Windows applications.

## RISC-V Platform Evaluation

Following up on last month's updates, we surveyed the effect of common optimization flags on SPEC CPU2017 benchmark results, especially on RISC-V platforms.  `-flto` and `-ffast-math` were found to be the most commonly used flags (in combination with `-O3`). Below are the performance uplift we observed on x86:

![image](https://github.com/mollybuild/RISCV-Measurement/assets/26591790/d434b2ca-efa1-4214-919c-5add21f6dfa8)

We also tested briefly jemalloc's performance on x86 and RISC-V platforms. While performance gains for memory operations on RISC-V is not significant, on x86, we observed a 25% uplift.

We also explored other flags, see our [detailed report](https://github.com/mollybuild/RISCV-Measurement/edit/master/SPEC-CPU2017-Compiler-Flags-Study.md).

Here are some updated SPEC CPU2017 figures obtained from Unmatched (GCC 13.1.0, `-O3`).

![image](https://github.com/mollybuild/PLCT-Weekly/assets/26591790/1eacdf77-40d2-4a0f-8c84-ae1c11bd389b)

An error may occur while running 657.xz_s due to memory depletion, as the benchmark requires 16GiB of RAM and Unmatched ships with the same amount.

## Testing and Development

- Implemented and fine-tuned performance benchmarks for LAVA jobs running on an Unmatched board with openEuler riscv64.
  - Surveyed the libmicro benchmark and assembled a [report](https://gitee.com/jean9823/openEuler_riscv_performance_test/blob/master/openEuler%20riscv64%E4%B8%AD%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8libmicro%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E5%AF%B9%E5%90%84%E7%A7%8D%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E8%B0%83%E7%94%A8%E5%92%8Clib%E8%B0%83%E7%94%A8%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.md)
  - Completed writing and fine-tuning testcases and for unixbench, stream, libmicro, fio, lmbench, and netperf. These testcases now runs properly on LAVA, see https://gitlab.com/jean9823/lava-testcase
  - LTP syscalls testcases now runs on LAVA jobs, see https://gitlab.com/jean9823/lava-testcase/-/blob/main/lava_job/unmatched/sifive-unmatched-ltp-syscalls-test.yaml
- Developed and tested `ruyibuild` and wrote sample build scripts for Qemu.
